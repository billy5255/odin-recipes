    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Most of the prep work that goes into this easy recipe for scalloped potatoes is slicing potatoes and onions as thinly as you can. The thinner the slices, the better the final dish. After that, you'll simply layer the ingredients, and bake for 45 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and the creamy sauce is bubbling with a golden brown crust over the top.

        Tip: Scalloped potatoes will shrink a bit as they cook, but the sauce may bubble up over the sides of the baking dish. You can place a lined baking sheet underneath to catch any drips.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: Use your choice of potatoes for this recipe. Some home cooks use starchy russet potatoes and others prefer all-purpose Yukon Gold potatoes â€“ either kind works well but there are differences in the outcome. Russet potatoes will add their starchiness to the dish as they cook, helping the sauce thicken. Yukon Gold potatoes aren't as starchy, and will hold their shape better as they cook.</li>
        <li>Onion: Choose a medium sized yellow or white onion to add savory flavor to the scalloped potatoes.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps thicken the sauce as the scalloped potatoes bake. You'll sprinkle flour over each layer of potatoes so the sauce thickens evenly.</li>
        <li>Butter: A generous amount of butter distributed on each layer of potatoes adds richness.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt and pepper enhance the flavor of the dish. Be sure to season each layer as you build up the casserole.</li>
        <li>Milk: This recipe recommends using whole milk, but you can also use half-and-half or cream for a richer flavor and texture. Whichever you choose to use, be sure to warm the liquid before pouring it over the potatoes, otherwise the scalloped potatoes will take longer to bake. The recipe calls for three cups, "or as needed." Translation: Pour in as much warm milk as you need to come up just even with the final layer of potatoes. That milk will develop a caramelized brown crust as the scalloped potatoes bake in the oven. Some home cooks like to sprinkle an optional layer of breadcrumbs or grated cheese over the top as well to enhance the golden brown crust.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/3 of the potato slices into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with about 1/3 of the onion slices. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour over the potato and onion. Arrange 2 tablespoons butter atop the flour. Season the entire layer with salt and pepper. Repeat layering twice more.</li>
        <li>Heat milk in a saucepan until warm. Pour enough warm milk over the mixture in the baking dish so the top of the liquid is level with the final layer of potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
